move_down = ["n", "Down"]    # Use n instead of j to move down
refresh = ["R"]              # Use R instead of r to refresh
start_filter = ["/", "f"]   # Use f in addition to / for filter

[keys.global]
force_quit = ["C-q"]         # Use Ctrl+q instead of Ctrl+c to quit
```

Modes: `global`, `board`, `project_select`, `detail_content`, `detail_sidebar`, `card_grab`, `confirm`, `comment_list`, `status_select`, `sidebar_edit`, etc.

Key notation: `j`, `Enter`, `Esc`, `Tab`, `S-Tab`, `Space`, `Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`, `Backspace`, `C-c` (Ctrl), `A-x` (Alt)
